  <p style="font-size: xx-large;">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic.
  However, the first case may be traced back to 17 November, 2019.As of 28 May 2020, more than 5.8 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 359,000 deaths. More than 2.39 million people have recovered.</p>
  <p style="font-size:xx-large;">Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely precipitated by a cytokine storm,multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.</p>
  <p style="font-size: xx-large;">The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking.The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.</p>
